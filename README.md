# Recipal
Chrome extension for reading recipes online.

Currently works with foodnetwork.com, cooking.nytimes.com, and allrecipes.com recipes.

Simply go to the Chrome Web Store and [add ReciPal to Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recipal/anjddddadbidepgpkplajdifkhnbacpg). When you are on the page of a recipe on foodnetwork.com, cooking.nytimes.com, or allrecipes.com click on the ReciPal logo and the ingredients will highlight within the direction text. If you hover over the highlighted words a tooltip will appear with the quantities of that ingredient that are required.
